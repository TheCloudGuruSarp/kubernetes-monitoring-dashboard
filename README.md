## Features

- Real-time monitoring of Kubernetes cluster resources and workloads
- Customizable dashboards for visualizing various performance metrics
- Sophisticated alerting system for proactive incident response
- Centralized log aggregation and advanced analysis capabilities
- Detailed resource utilization visualization and trend analysis

## Architecture

The solution implements a multi-layered monitoring architecture where Prometheus serves as the core metrics collection and storage engine, Grafana provides advanced visualization capabilities through customizable dashboards, and Loki handles log aggregation with full-text search functionality. All components are deployed as microservices within the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring high availability and scalability.

## Components

- **Prometheus**: Time-series database for metrics collection, storage, and querying with a powerful PromQL language
- **Grafana**: Advanced data visualization platform with support for multiple data sources and alerting capabilities
- **Loki**: Horizontally-scalable, highly-available log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus
- **Alertmanager**: Sophisticated alert handling system with deduplication, grouping, and routing capabilities
- **Node Exporter**: Specialized exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *nix kernels
- **kube-state-metrics**: Service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of objects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.19+) with RBAC enabled
- Helm package manager (v3.0+) for deployment orchestration
- kubectl CLI tool configured with appropriate cluster access credentials
- Sufficient cluster resources (recommended: at least 3 worker nodes with 4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM each)

### Installation

```bash
# Add Helm repositories
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Create namespace
kubectl create namespace monitoring

# Install Prometheus Stack
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --values ./helm/prometheus-values.yaml

# Install Loki Stack
helm install loki grafana/loki-stack \
  --namespace monitoring \
  --values ./helm/loki-values.yaml
```

## Dashboard Examples

The solution includes several pre-configured dashboards:

- **Cluster Overview**: Holistic view of cluster health, resource utilization, and workload distribution
- **Node Resources**: Detailed metrics on CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network performance for each node
- **Pod Resources**: Granular analysis of pod resource consumption patterns and runtime statistics
- **Application Metrics**: Custom application-specific metrics with support for RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) methodology
- **Log Analysis**: Advanced log visualization with pattern recognition and anomaly detection

## Alerting Configuration

The monitoring system includes a comprehensive alerting framework defined in `./prometheus/alerts.yaml`. This configuration can be extensively customized to meet specific operational requirements and SLAs. The alerting rules follow a hierarchical structure with severity levels (critical, warning, info) and include intelligent grouping to prevent alert storms during cascading failures.
